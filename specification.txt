--- abstract

I'd like to get familiar with the different browser extension APIs (Chrome,
Firefox, Opera, and Edge) and learn how to develop, test, package and
publish a cross-browser extension.

# Introduction
The project was initially created for the SUSE Hackweek 2019.

# Perspective
The extension was developed to learn more about the web extension API and how
to develop, test, build, package, and publish a cross-browser extension. It is
an open source project.
The web extension itself should be very simple because the focus is on the
continous integration process for cross-browser extensions.
The extension will identify all <script></script> or <link/> tags in the DOM
of a website and block them optionally.

# Functions

1. Get the DOM of website
2. Parse the DOM of a website
3. Reads the user specified options
4. Identify all <script></script> tags in the DOM
5. Identify all <link/> tags in the DOM
6. Block all <script>/script> tags
7. Block all <link/> tags

# Operating Environment
The same code base of the web extension should run in:

* Firefox
* Microsoft Edge
* Chromium
* Google Chrome
* Opera

# Design and Implementation Constraints
The web extension is developed in Javascript.

# User Interfaces
## Options

* Block <script></script> tags
* Block <link/> tags
* Block nothing


## Action Command

* Show all identified <script></script> tags
* Show all identified <link/> tags
